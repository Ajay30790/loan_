# 🏦 Loan Rejection Prediction & Risk Analytics System

**IIT Jammu — Internship Program | Week 5 Assignment**

A Streamlit web application that predicts loan rejection risk using machine
learning, built on the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) 2019 dataset.

---

## 🆕 Enhanced Edition — What's Different

This version was rebuilt for reliability and usability on top of the original:

- **Robust file loading** — checks multiple likely paths for the dataset and
  model (`SCFP2019.csv`, `data/SCFP2019.csv`, etc.). If a file isn't found,
  the app shows an upload box instead of a blank page or crash.
- **One-click sidebar navigation** — real buttons instead of radio dots, with
  a clearly highlighted active page.
- **Currency in ₹ (INR)** — all financial figures across the app use rupees.
- **Batch Prediction** — upload a CSV of many applicants and get predictions
  for all of them at once, with a downloadable results file.
- **Prediction History** — every single-applicant prediction made in your
  session is logged and can be exported to CSV.
- **Live-computed fallbacks** — if pre-rendered confusion matrix / ROC curve
  images aren't found, the app computes and plots them on the fly.
- **Defensive column handling** — pages skip a chart gracefully (with a note)
  if an expected column is missing from the dataset, instead of crashing.
- **Downloadable reports** — summary stats, dataset export, single prediction
  reports, and batch results can all be downloaded directly from the app.

> **Note:** `SCFP2019.csv` and the `model/` files are technically optional —
> the app won't crash without them. You'll just be prompted to upload them
> in-browser, and some pages (Model Performance, Predict, Batch Prediction)
> will show a message until a model is available.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

### 2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add your data and model files
Place `SCFP2019.csv` in the project root (or in a `data/` subfolder), and
your trained model at `model/loan_rejection_model.pkl`.

### 5. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) 2019
- **Records**: 23,000+ households
- **Features**: 200+ financial and demographic variables

### Target Variable — `LOAN_REJECTED`
Derived from multiple indicators:
| Source column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TURNDOWN` | Credit application turned down |
| `FEARDENIAL` | Fear of denial (didn't apply due to expected rejection) |
| `BNKRUPLAST5` | Bankruptcy in the last 5 years |
| `FORECLLAST5` | Foreclosure in the last 5 years |
| `LATE60` | 60+ days late on a payment |
| `HPAYDAY` | Payday loan usage |

### Risk Indicators
| Indicator | Rule |
|---|---|
| High DTI | Debt-to-Income ratio > 0.4 |
| High Leverage | Leverage ratio > 0.5 |
| Low Savings | No savings account |
| No Emergency Savings | No emergency fund |

## 🤖 Models

The app expects a pickled dictionary at `model/loan_rejection_model.pkl` with:
```python
{
    "model": <trained sklearn-compatible classifier>,
    "scaler": <fitted StandardScaler (or similar)>,
    "feature_names": [<list of feature columns in training order>],
    "model_name": "Random Forest",           # optional, for display
    "performance": {                          # optional, for display
        "accuracy": 0.78,
        "precision": 0.71,
        "recall": 0.66,
        "f1": 0.68,
        "roc_auc": 0.81
    }
}
```
Models experimented with during development: **Logistic Regression**
(baseline), **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting**.

## 🚀 Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push this repository to GitHub (make sure `SCFP2019.csv` and the `model/`
   folder are committed — GitHub's web upload supports files up to 25 MB;
   larger files need [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)).
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), connect your
   GitHub account, and select this repository.
3. Set the main file path to `app.py`.
4. Deploy — Streamlit Cloud installs everything in `requirements.txt`
   automatically.
